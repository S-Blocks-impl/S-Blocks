Integration of firewall. 

decompress vnids.tar.gz ==> You will get click directory. 
decompress firewall_click_script.tar.gz  ==> You will get evaluation directory. 

You can find most firewall-related code at: 
click/elements/standards

Then go to 
evaluation/etc/statefirewall_01.click 

Check statefirewall_01.click carefully. Take notes of which Elements have been used. 

Then go to 
click/elements/standards/ 

Find all the elements required by statefirewall_01.click 
Move those elements into your code. 
Try to compile. If sth is missing. You should go back to the click directory (decompressed from vnids.tar.gz) and try to find the missing parts. 


Repeat the above process until you can successfully compile and run firewall in your system.
