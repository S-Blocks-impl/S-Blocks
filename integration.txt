Integration of firewall. 

decompress vnids.tar.gz ==> You will get click directory. 
decompress firewall_click_script.tar.gz  ==> You will get evaluation directory. 

You can find all the firewall-related code at: 
 + click/elements/vfw 

But this is not guaranteed since the vfw is ported from ClickOS. I may miss something. 
If you find problems, please let me know (hongdal@clemson.edu). 


After you have successfully compiled and built vids+vfw, you can try to run the firewall:
 + ./userlevel/click ./conf/statefirewall_01.click

More scripts about virtual firewall (vfw) can be found at:
 + evaluation/etc/statefirewall_01.click 


Trouble shooting by yourself:

 + Check statefirewall_01.click carefully. Take notes of which Elements have been used. 
 + Go to  click/include or click/lib or clicke/elements to find any files you need. 
 + Find all the elements required by statefirewall_01.click. 
 + Move those elements into your code. 
 + Try to compile. If sth is missing. You should go back to the click directory and try to find the missing parts. 
 + Repeat the above process until you can successfully compile and run firewall in your system. 


About .click file: 
 + The statefirewall_01.click is just a demo. You should try to understand it. 
 + Some modification may be necessary if you want to use it in a different environment.
